- calculate energy usage by taking voltage per block, mcpat stats
- calculate EDP by energy * CPI or energy * IPC (look up formula)
- in future we look to also increase frequency for better performance, not just improving energy efficiency by maintaining frequency
- voltage levels span from 0.6-0.9
