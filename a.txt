- closest round up voltage, not lose performance
- define baseline voltage in config file, not in script
- find papers that improve energy efficiency at compile-time
-  journals/conferences: CGO, CC, PACT, MICRO, ISCA, HPCA, ASPLOS, Journals: ACM TACO, ACM TECS, IEEE TC, IEEE TPDS, IEEE TCAD, IEEE TVLSI)
- implementing remaining features
  - block splitting
  - run analysis on path-clubbed, not just per-basic block
  - (just try, unlikely) gem5 instruction insertion and profiling

Additional statistics per program
- consider voltage scaling delay, get values from previous papers
-   number of voltage scaling events
- ips, edp, peak temp
